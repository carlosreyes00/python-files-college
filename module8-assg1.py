# Create a class named BankSystem that simulates basic banking operations.
# The class should have two attributes: customer_name and starting_balance,
# which are set when the class is instantiated.

# Your class should include functions that are able to:

# Calculate Deposits: Adds a specified amount to the customer's balance.
# Process Withdrawals: Deduct a specified amount from the customer's balance. 
# If the withdrawal amount exceeds the current balance,
# display a message indicating that the transaction cannot be completed.
# Ensure that NO funds are withdrawn if the balance would drop below zero.
# Display Customer Information: Returns the customerâ€™s name and current balance.
# These items should be returned/printed from the function. After implementing the class,

# write code to:
# Create two BankSystem objects with different customer names and starting balances.
# Perform a deposit operation on one object and a withdrawal operation on the other.
# Display the Customer Information for both objects to show their final balances.
# Sample Console: 

# (Based on an Object with a name of Devin and a starting value of $1,000. )

# >>What is your deposit amount? 200
# >>1200
# >>What is your withdrawal amount? 1300
# >>Insufficient Funds. 
# >>Hello Devin. Your current Balance is $1,200.
